# Assnake Framework

The Assnake Framework is a comprehensive tool designed for metagenomic and microbiome data analysis, primarily focusing on Illumina sequencing data. It offers a range of functionalities for quality control, preprocessing, assembly, binning, and taxonomic and functional annotations.

## Features

- **Quality Control**: Assess the quality of raw sequencing data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes trimming, filtering, and other preprocessing steps.
- **Metagenomic Assembly**: Assemble reads into longer contigs.
- **Binning**: Group contigs into putative genomes.
- **Taxonomic Annotation**: Annotate sequences with taxonomic information.
- **Functional Annotation**: Assign functional roles to sequences.
- **16S rRNA Analysis**: Specialized tools for 16S rRNA data.

## Installation

Before installation, ensure you have Python 3.x and Conda installed on your system.

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AssnakeFramework.git
   cd AssnakeFramework
   ```

2. **Set up a Conda Environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   conda create -n assnake-env python=3.8
   conda activate assnake-env
   ```

3. **Install Assnake**:

   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Configuration

After installation, configure Assnake to set up the necessary environment and database paths:

```bash
assnake config init
```

Follow the prompts to specify paths for databases, conda environments, and other necessary configurations.

## Usage

The Assnake Framework offers a variety of commands and options. Here are some common usages:

- **Initialize a New Dataset**:

  ```bash
  assnake dataset init --name my_dataset --reads-path /path/to/reads
  ```

- **Run Quality Control**:

  ```bash
  assnake result quality-control --dataset my_dataset
  ```

- **Preprocess Data**:

  ```bash
  assnake result trimmomatic --dataset my_dataset --preset default
  ```

- **Assemble Metagenome**:

  ```bash
  assnake result metagenome-assemble --dataset my_dataset
  ```

For a complete list of commands and options, run `assnake --help`.
