# Assnake Metagenomic Analysis System

## Overview
Assnake is a comprehensive metagenomics analysis tool designed for Illumina sequencing data, focusing on microbiome studies. It combines various bioinformatics tools into an integrated workflow for metagenomic data processing and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Dataset and Sample Management:** Organizes datasets and individual biological samples.
- **Modular Preprocessing and Analysis:** Customizable preprocessing and analysis steps tailored to specific research needs.
- **Preset Management:** Ensures consistent and reproducible analyses through preset configurations.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** User-friendly CLI for easy access to functionalities.

## System Architecture
Assnake's architecture is centered around datasets containing unique samples. Each sample can go through several preprocessing stages, captured as `SampleContainers`. Pipelines manage the workflow, applying various `Results` and `Presets` for analysis.

## Installation
1. **Create a Conda Environment:** (Recommended to manage dependencies)
   ```bash
   conda create -n assnake_env python=3.10
   conda activate assnake_env
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ASSNAKE/assnake.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Repository and Install:**
   ```bash
   cd assnake
   pip install -e ./
   ```

4. **Initialize Assnake Configuration:**
   ```bash
   assnake config init
   ```

## Quick Start
