### Detailed Overview: Preprocessing Chains and SampleContainers in Assnake

Assnake's architecture efficiently manages biological sequencing data through preprocessing chains and SampleContainers. These concepts are crucial for understanding the systematic transformation of raw data into analyzable formats.

#### Understanding Preprocessing Chains

Preprocessing chains in Assnake are sequences of computational steps, each refining raw sequencing data for subsequent analysis.

- **Purpose:** Transform raw data (e.g., FASTQ format) by cleaning, formatting, and preparing it for downstream analysis.
- **Structure:** Each step in the chain is a distinct computational process, leveraging different tools and parameters to achieve specific objectives.

**Example of a Preprocessing Chain:**
1. **Start with Raw Data:** The process begins with raw sequencing data, typically in the FASTQ format.
2. **Step 1 - Cutadapt:** The first step involves using `cutadapt`, a tool for trimming adapters and low-quality sequences. A specific preset, `rmV3V4primers`, is applied.
3. **Step 2 - DADA2 Filter and Trim:** The next step employs DADA2's filter and trimming algorithms, with the `strict` preset.

Each step in the chain incrementally refines the data, enhancing its suitability for detailed analysis.

#### SampleContainers: Capturing Data States

SampleContainers in Assnake are pivotal for storing and managing the state of a sample's data at various preprocessing stages.

- **Function:** Holds information about a sample's sequencing data at a given preprocessing stage.
- **Multiplicity:** A single sample can have multiple SampleContainers, each reflecting its data state after undergoing different preprocessing steps.

**Key Features:**
- **Association with Samples:** Each SampleContainer is linked to a specific sample, tracking its processing history.
- **Data File Path Storage:** Contains paths to processed data files, facilitating quick access and retrieval.
- **Metadata on Preprocessing:** Includes comprehensive details such as preprocessing steps, tools used, and parameter settings.

**Workflow Integration:**
- As the sample progresses through the preprocessing chain, new SampleContainers are established, capturing each stage's data state.
- This provides a systematic way to access the sample's data at various processing levels.

**Illustrative Example:**
- Consider a sample named `Sample_A`.
- After undergoing the cutadapt step, `SampleContainer_1` is created, encompassing paths to files processed by cutadapt.
- Post-DADA2 processing, `SampleContainer_2` emerges, pointing to the files processed by DADA2.

In conclusion, the concepts of preprocessing chains and SampleContainers are integral to Assnake's data management. They provide a structured and efficient way to process, track, and access various states of NGS data, enhancing the overall analysis workflow.
