## Module Documentation

### Overview
Modules in Assnake are extensions or plugins that introduce additional functionalities, results, or analysis pipelines. They are designed to be self-contained, ensuring that the core functionality of Assnake can be extended without affecting the base system.

### Key Concepts
- **Modular Design:** Allows for the integration of new tools and workflows.
- **Self-Contained:** Each module has its own set of dependencies, workflows, and results.
- **Plug-and-Play:** Modules can be easily added or removed without impacting the core system.

### Implementation
Modules are typically implemented as separate Python packages and are registered with Assnake using Python's `entry_points`. This allows Assnake to discover and load modules dynamically at runtime.

### Usage
To view available modules:
```bash
assnake module list
```

## Result Documentation

### Overview
`Result` in Assnake represents a specific computational output or data processing step within a pipeline. It encapsulates the logic and parameters required to generate a particular type of analysis result.

### Key Features
- **Flexible Configuration:** Customizable parameters for different types of analyses.
- **Integration with Pipelines:** Directly tied to steps in analysis pipelines.
- **Output Management:** Handles the generation and organization of analysis outputs.

### Implementation
A `Result` object defines the command-line interface, input, output, and the Snakemake workflow for a particular analysis step. It includes details about the sample inputs and the expected outputs.

### Usage
Results are typically invoked as part of a pipeline or directly via the CLI for specific analyses.

## Preset and PresetManager Documentation

### Preset Overview
A `Preset` in Assnake is a pre-defined set of parameters for a particular `Result`. It allows users to quickly configure analysis steps with a consistent set of parameters.

### Key Features
- **Standardized Analyses:** Enables reproducibility and standardization.
- **Easy Configuration:** Simplifies the setup of complex analysis parameters.
- **Flexibility:** Supports global and dataset-specific presets.

### PresetManager Overview
`PresetManager` is responsible for managing and deploying presets within Assnake. It handles the discovery, loading, and updating of presets for various results and modules.

### Key Functions
- **Preset Deployment:** Deploys presets into the Assnake database.
- **Preset Discovery:** Finds and loads presets from the database or specific datasets.
- **Preset Updates:** Ensures presets are up-to-date with their definitions.

### Usage
Presets are typically specified during the invocation of a `Result` or when configuring a pipeline. The `PresetManager` ensures that the appropriate presets are applied.
