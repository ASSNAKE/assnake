# Overview of the Assnake Framework's System Architecture

The Assnake Framework is a sophisticated system designed for comprehensive analysis of metagenomic and microbiome data, with a focus on Illumina sequencing data. Its architecture is modular, scalable, and user-friendly, catering to both researchers and bioinformatics professionals.

## Core Components

### 1. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**

- **Function**: Serves as the primary user interface for interacting with the framework.
- **Implementation**: Built using Python's `click` library, offering a range of subcommands and options for various functionalities.
- **Features**: Dataset management, result request and execution, module interaction, and configuration settings.

### 2. **Configuration Management**

- **Internal and Instance Configurations**: 
  - **Internal Configuration**: Stores fundamental settings like the instance configuration's location.
  - **Instance Configuration**: Contains paths for the database, conda environments, and other essential directories.
- **Tools Used**: Python's `yaml` library for reading and writing configurations, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.

### 3. **Pipeline Execution and Snakemake Integration**

- **Pipeline Class**: Facilitates the definition and execution of analytical pipelines.
- **Snakemake Integration**: Enables complex workflow management, efficiently handling dependencies and execution across multiple steps.
- **Data Flow**: Pipelines are constructed dynamically, allowing for the creation of target file paths and integration with Snakemake for execution.

### 4. **Result Management**

- **Result Class**: Central to defining individual analysis steps, encapsulating the logic for CLI invocation, Snakemake integration, and handling of sample sets and presets.
- **Preset Management**: Managed by the `PresetManager` class, allowing for the deployment, selection, and management of presets for various analyses.

### 5. **Dataset and Sample Management**

- **Dataset and Sample Classes**: Handle the representation of biological samples and datasets, aiding in organizing and processing sequencing data.
- **Sample Container and Container Set Classes**: Manage groups of samples, facilitating operations across multiple samples simultaneously.

## Modular Design

- **Plugin System**: Enables the addition of new modules and results through a plugin architecture, enhancing the extensibility of the framework.
- **Module Definition**: Each module, like `assnake-core-preprocessing`, contains specific results, workflows, and configurations, organized in a structured directory.

## Workflow Management

- **Workflow Definition**: Defined using Snakemake rules, specifying input, output, and execution parameters.
- **Wrapper Scripts**: Parse presets and construct shell scripts for execution, ensuring flexibility and customization for different analysis steps.

## User Interaction and Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Users configure the system using the `assnake config init` command, setting up essential paths and environments.
2. **Dataset Management**: Datasets are created, imported, and managed through the CLI.
3. **Analysis Request**: Users request specific results or pipelines for their datasets.
4. **Execution**: The system compiles target paths, constructs pipelines, and executes them using Snakemake, handling dependencies and resource management.

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensures user-friendly error messages and system stability.
- **Logging**: Maintains logs for tracking and debugging purposes, essential for long-running and complex analyses.

In summary, the Assnake Framework's architecture is designed to be robust, modular, and user-centric, addressing the complexities of metagenomic data analysis with efficiency and scalability.
