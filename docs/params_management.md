### Preset and PresetManager in Assnake

In Assnake, presets play a crucial role in standardizing and streamlining the execution of various results and pipelines. The `Preset` and `PresetManager` classes are central to managing these configurations.

#### Preset

A `Preset` in Assnake is a predefined configuration for a specific result or pipeline step. It encapsulates parameter settings and options that are reused across different runs or datasets, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

- **Purpose:**
  - To store and manage a fixed set of parameters for a particular computational task.
  - To enable quick and consistent setup for repeated analyses.

- **Structure:**
  - A `Preset` typically includes parameters like thresholds, flags, and paths to necessary files.
  - It is often saved as a text, JSON, or YAML file containing key-value pairs of parameters and their respective values.

- **Usage:**
  - When running a pipeline or result, a user can specify which preset to use.
  - The preset's parameters are then applied to the task, bypassing the need for manual parameter entry.

#### PresetManager

The `PresetManager` is responsible for handling and organizing multiple presets within Assnake. It ensures that the correct presets are available and used for each result or pipeline.

- **Functionalities:**
  - **Loading Presets:** Retrieves and loads presets from the filesystem, either from a global directory or specific to a dataset.
  - **Finding Presets:** Searches for a specific preset by name, either globally or within a dataset's scope.
  - **Updating Presets:** Manages updates to presets, ensuring that the latest versions are used.
  - **Copying Presets:** Facilitates copying presets from a global location to a dataset-specific location, maintaining a hierarchy of presets.

- **Workflow Integration:**
  - Integrated with the `Result` class, allowing results to specify which presets are applicable.
  - Used in CLI commands to provide users with options to select or specify presets.

- **Example:**
  - In a metagenomic analysis pipeline, a `PresetManager` might manage different presets for quality filtering, such as "stringent," "moderate," and "lenient," each with different parameter settings.

#### Implementing Presets and PresetManager

To implement and use these concepts in a real-world scenario:

1. **Define Presets:**
   - Create configuration files for each preset with the necessary parameters.
   - Store these files in an accessible location within the Assnake environment.

2. **Use PresetManager in Results:**
   - In the definition of a `Result`, utilize `PresetManager` to handle the selection and application of presets.
   - Allow users to choose a preset when running the result.

3. **CLI Integration:**
   - Extend the CLI interface to enable users to select presets for different results or pipelines.

4. **Maintain and Update:**
   - Regularly update and maintain the preset files to reflect the latest methodologies and standards.

In summary, `Preset` and `PresetManager` streamline the process of applying consistent configurations across various tasks in Assnake, enhancing the framework's usability and reproducibility.
