Each result produces one ore more files or directories. Should we describe each file or directory somewhere?

Migration mechanisms?

If we update wcs, we need to:
1. Make shure that all other rules that use this wc are updated, any code is updated too. We introduces wc_config for that.
2. Describe what files or folders we need to find and how to update their locations.
   a. We don't introduce any new wildcards by updating wc_str.
      Just find files, grab wildcards, new_str.format(**wildcards); os.makedirs(), mv files_old files_new, rm -r old_dirs
   b. We introduce new wildcards.
      We need to define default value for new wildcards. Than as in a.
